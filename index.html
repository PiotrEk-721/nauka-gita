                <h1>Taarlo</h1>
                <i>by Herman De Coninck</i>
                <p>
                    We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.
                    And in spring too I feel no different.
                    We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves
                    through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,
                </p>
                <p>
                    that deepens in the cellar of the years.
                    We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.
                    Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees
                    sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    33, and in the midst of the dark wood
                    of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,
                    at home in the woods and desolate at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will we one day, maybe, ever?
                    The summer is past, the hay-making is over.
                    The here is nowhere, and the now is never.
                </p>
